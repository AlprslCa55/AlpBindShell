# AlpBindShell
A shell coded in Python version 2.7

Target Run : python reverse.py 

Attacker run : (Default linux) nc <IP> <PORT> 

Run the script and connect another device.If you connected you can execute command in it 


    I used thread because subprocess is sensitive. Sometimes when they run successive steps some attackers commands can not executed.
So , I think like that and subprocess can execute command without exception0
